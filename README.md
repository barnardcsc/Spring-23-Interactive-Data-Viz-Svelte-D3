# Interactive Data Visualization Using Svelte and D3, Spring 2023

This is the second of a two-part series co-sponsored by the Computational Science Center (CSC) and Empirical Reasoning Center (ERC) on Interactive Data Visualization and Storytelling!

We've all seen cool visualizations featured on websites that are interactive and engaging. We're able to engage with the data in a completely different way than when they're static charts/graphs/maps on paper or even on a website. Come join us to learn how to create beautiful and interactive data visualizations like those using Svelte and D3!

Some familiarity with HTML, CSS, or JavaScript would be helpful, but is not required. 

This workshop is led by Fatima Koli, Senior Associate Director of the Empirical Reasoning Center (ERC) at Barnard College.
